                        <p>
                            Reported to the Prime Minister, Colonel Nguyen Van Si, Head of Logistics, Military Command of Tra Vinh province, said that so far, nearly 2,400 people have been received and isolated. Basically, the quarantined people strictly abide by the regulations.
                            Officers and soldiers strictly perform their assigned tasks.<br>
                            <br> Speaking to officials and soldiers on duty at the isolation area, the Prime Minister stated that, after four outbreaks of the epidemic, the next one was more difficult and unpredictable than the previous one, leaving more
                            consequences and outbreak The current outbreak is very complicated, the new strain of virus spreads very quickly and is very dangerous. However, we still basically control the epidemic situation across the country. Provinces
                            with epidemics are also gradually controlling the situation. The rate of cases is only 0.004% of the population, among the lowest in the world and in the region.<br>
                            <br> Along with that, we focus on preparing well for the election, continuing to develop socio-economic, increasing budget revenue, people trust in the leadership of the Party, management of the State and the participation
                            of the whole political system, agencies, departments and localities.<br>
                            <br> Through the epidemics, we have learned better epidemic prevention experiences, in which the isolation measure plays a very important role according to the motto of fast tracing, fast detection, fast isolation, fast control.
                            positive treatment, quickly stabilize the situation.<br>
                            <br> The current epidemic has occurred on a large scale, but the source of the disease has not been detected in the country, the sources of transmission are all from outside by air, sea and land, the Prime Minister said.<br>
                            <br> On behalf of the Party and State leaders, the Prime Minister praised the forces participating in the prevention of COVID-19 with the spirit of "fighting the epidemic like fighting the enemy", in which the medical, military
                            and police forces on the front lines and several other industries. In addition to the achieved results, there are still shortcomings and limitations, in which the isolation management in some places still has loopholes and
                            has not properly implemented the principles and regulations. Some agencies, units, people, and a part of the people are still subjective, negligent and lethargic, including isolation units. The Prime Minister stated that timely
                            commendation goes hand in hand with tightening discipline and discipline. Those who do well should be commended and rewarded, but must resolutely deal with units and individuals that do not do right or not strictly.<br>
                            <br> Currently, across the country, there are 2,047 areas that are undergoing concentrated isolation and are capable of implementing isolation, of which the military has 356 zones. The total number of people in concentrated
                            isolation is about 58,000 and has prepared for the isolation of more than 100,000 people, including F0, F1 cases and people entering from outside.<br>
                            <br> Noting that people entering from outside are the biggest risk of spreading the disease, the Prime Minister also emphasized that the policy for quarantined people shows the humane and humanitarian spirit of the Party, State
                            and our people. General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong has made it very clear that he does not sacrifice social progress and justice to pursue economic growth alone; This is the point of view of our Party and State, but the more
                            in the context of the epidemic, the more attention is paid to this point of view, especially for the weak and those who are sick. Those who need to be isolated at the hotel have additional contributions, but basically, the
                            isolation work is still guaranteed by the State, the state budget also takes care of all medicines and medical supplies to treat people. sick.<br>
                            <br> The Prime Minister requested that all levels of Party committees, authorities, Fatherland Front, mass organizations and comrades directly perform tasks in quarantine zones must strictly implement guidelines, guidelines,
                            policies and laws. laws of the Party and State; regulations on prevention of COVID-19; regulations on isolation, isolation management; regulations on handover and management after isolation. People and communities must step
                            in to manage people who are returned to their localities and families after quarantine.<br>
                            <br> â€œThus, the subject leads and directs; the subject of organizing the implementation; quarantined person; persons related to the quarantined person; Communities, families and society must strictly and strictly comply with
                            the regulations of the Party, State and professional agencies in order to effectively isolate, prevent and repel the epidemic. results," emphasized the Prime Minister.<br>
                            <br> Along with that, the Prime Minister requested correct and complete awareness and well implementation of the harmonious, reasonable and effective combination between disease prevention and attack, taking attack as the main;
                            rooms are regular, basic, decisive. Attack is a good implementation of the 5K+vaccine requirement; extensive screening tests; effectively implement the vaccine strategy; step up the preparation of supplies, equipment, biological
                            products... according to the motto of 4 on the spot and suitable to epidemic situations that may occur; implementation of assignment, decentralization and authorization in parallel with strengthening supervision and checking
                            actively and effectively. Mobilizing the participation and participation of the people in the spirit of each person protecting their own health, contributing to the protection of public health, and protecting the interests
                            of the nation and nation.<br>
                            <br> Analyzing the vaccine strategy more specifically, the Prime Minister said that it is implementing well. Vietnam has signed and negotiated with partners on vaccine supply with a total of more than 100 million doses; to
                            step up access to and transfer of vaccine technology and research and manufacture vaccines in the country.<br>
                            <br> The Prime Minister affirmed that the general principle is that the State ensures maximum funding when possible to vaccinate the entire population free of charge, prioritizing frontline forces to fight the epidemic such
                            as health care, army and police. Current research shows that the vaccine has a short-lasting immune effect, the injection must be carried out periodically, so the cost is very large, the Prime Minister said. However, in the
                            context of budget difficulties, the Government is building a vaccine fund in the spirit of calling and encouraging organizations, businesses, people and communities to contribute funds and work together with the Government
                            to secure this issue in the spirit of proactive attack. The use of the fund ensures publicity, transparency and compliance with regulations and laws.<br>
                            <br> "The people's health comes first, first of all, each healthy citizen is the whole people, the whole population is healthy, the country is healthy, the country is healthy then it can carry out the task of building and defending
                            the country." Prime Minister said.<br>
                            <br> The Prime Minister requested to thoroughly understand and strictly implement the guiding documents and regulations of the Secretariat, the Government, the Prime Minister, the Head of the Steering Committee, the Minister
                            of Health and the notes of the State President. , strengthen the responsibility of localities, agencies and organizations, personalize individual responsibility, reward and discipline in time. He reiterated and emphasized that
                            both trends must be avoided: Negligence, subjectivity, loss of vigilance when there is no epidemic, but panic, anxiety, confusion, lack of bravery when there is an epidemic, and application of measures. extreme.<br>
                            <br> The Prime Minister hoped that the military units, officers and soldiers on duty in the isolated areas continue to successfully complete their tasks in the spirit of patriotic emulation, determination to win, and further
